I moved my blog to [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] using [Jekyll][jekyll] as the static page
generator. This blog will be a collection of articles and ramblings about programming, security,
algorithms, and technology in general.

[gh-pages]: https://github.com/netromdk/netromdk.github.io
[jekyll]: https://jekyllrb.com
